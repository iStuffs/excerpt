        <div class="article__content">
          <p>Vue (pronounced /vjuː/, like view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries.</p>

          <p>  The official guide assumes intermediate level knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you are totally new to frontend development, it might not be the best idea to jump right into a framework as your first step - grasp the basics then come back! Prior experience with other frameworks helps, but is not required.</p>

          <p>The easiest way to try out Vue.js is using the JSFiddle Hello World example. Feel free to open it in another tab and follow along as we go through some basic examples. Or, you can create an index.html file and include Vue with a cdn</p>
